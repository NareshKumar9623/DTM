# Deployment Guide

## Issue Resolution: Firebase Configuration

The application was showing "Firebase not configured" because the `dist` files were built locally without environment variables rather than through GitHub Actions.

## Solution

1. **Improved Build Process**: The build script now shows clear warnings when environment variables are missing
2. **Enhanced Debugging**: Firebase configuration now provides better logging for troubleshooting
3. **Proper Deployment**: Deployment must happen through GitHub Actions for environment variables to be injected

## Required GitHub Repository Secrets

To deploy this application successfully, ensure these secrets are set in your GitHub repository:

**Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Repository secrets**

### Required Secrets:
- `FIREBASE_API_KEY` - Your Firebase project API key
- `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` - Your Firebase auth domain (project-id.firebaseapp.com)
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - Your Firebase project ID
- `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` - Your Firebase storage bucket
- `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` - Your Firebase messaging sender ID
- `FIREBASE_APP_ID` - Your Firebase app ID
- `FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID` - Your Firebase measurement ID (optional)

### How to Get Firebase Configuration:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Project Settings (gear icon)
4. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
5. Click on the web app or create one
6. Copy the configuration values

### Verification:

After setting up the secrets and pushing to main branch:

1. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy
2. Check the Actions tab to see deployment progress
3. Visit your GitHub Pages URL
4. Open browser console to see Firebase configuration status
5. The console should show "Firebase initialized successfully"

### Troubleshooting:

- **Local Development**: Will show warnings about missing Firebase config (this is expected)
- **Production Issues**: Check GitHub Actions logs for build errors
- **Firebase Errors**: Verify all secrets are set correctly in GitHub repository

### Environment Variable Injection:

The build process injects environment variables into the HTML file during GitHub Actions deployment. Local builds will have empty values, which is expected for security.

## Next Steps:

1. Verify GitHub repository secrets are set
2. Push any changes to trigger deployment
3. Monitor GitHub Actions for successful deployment
4. Test the live application at your GitHub Pages URL

The application should now work correctly when deployed through GitHub Actions with proper Firebase configuration!
